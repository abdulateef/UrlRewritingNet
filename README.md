﻿UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite
===============

Welcome to the repository of UrlRewritingNet.UrlRewrite, a component for easy and reliable rewriting URLs with ASP.NET.

Based on “[ASP.NET HTTP module for URL redirections](http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/265719)” of [Fabrice Marguerie](http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie) it has been improved and enhanced by [Thomas Bandt](https://thomasbandt.com/) and [Albert Weinert](http://blog.der-albert.com/).

# System Requirements

The component was designed and developed in 2006 for running with ASP.NET 2.0, but it works with newer versions of ASP.NET as well. The only requirement is a Webserver running ASP.NET, for example Internet Information Services (IIS, Version >= 5.0).
